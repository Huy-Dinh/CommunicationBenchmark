# Communication Benchmark

## Overview

This is the repository of a communication benchmark library that can be used to run benchmark tests on communication protocols that provide a packetizing mechanism.

The library is used for the benchmarking of several embedded communication channels during the conduction of my Master's thesis at Robert Bosch GmbH, Renningen and Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany.
